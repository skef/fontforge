illuminated pictures cunningly inset. But nowadays, instead of looking at
books, people read them. A book might as well be one of those orders for
bacon and bran that you are scribbling.

XXX dialog picture

You can “start fresh” and create a new font database in FontForge in
three ways:
<UL>
<LI> If you start the program without specifying a font file FontForge
will bring up the XXX Open Font dialog. Pressing <CODE>New</CODE>
in the bottom center of that dialog will create a new database.
<LI> If another font is already open, you can choose the <CODE>New</CODE>
command from the <CODE>File</CODE> menu (or type <CODE>Ctrl-n</CODE>).
<LI> You can start FontForge with the command-line argument “<CODE>-new</CODE>”. 
</UL>

<P> <IMG SRC="newfont.png" WIDTH="419" HEIGHT="189">

<P> Every font should have a name and some other basic information, which you
can add with the <CODE><A HREF="fontinfo.html">Font Info</A></CODE> command 
from the <CODE>Element</CODE> menu. Among many other things you can use this
dialog to set the copyright message and change the ascent and descent. The
ideal values metrics depend on the type of font you eventually plan to generate,
but 1024 and 2048 are good sums for TrueType and OpenType fonts. 

<P> <IMG SRC="fontinfo.png" WIDTH="614" HEIGHT="548">

<P> You may also wish to use <CODE>Encoding-&gt;Reencode</CODE> to change what
characters are available in your font. FontForge generally creates new fonts
with an ISO-8859-1, which contains (most of) the characters needed for Western
Europe (the latin letters, some accented letters, digits, and symbols). Unicode
BMP and Unicode Full are other good choices, although these can lead to a lot
of scrolling.

<H2 id="FontCreate">Opening a Font</H2>

There are also three ways of opening an existing font, which can be in FontForge's
own “sfd” database format or a format like OpenType, TrueType, or a Postscript font:
<UL>
<LI> If you start the program without specifying a font file FontForge
will bring up the XXX Open Font dialog. Here you can navigate to the file
or type the name in directly and then press <CODE>OK</CODE> to open that
file. 
<LI> If another font is already open, you can choose the <CODE>Open</CODE>
command from the <CODE>File</CODE> menu (or type <CODE>Ctrl-o</CODE>).
<LI> You can start FontForge from the command line with the full path to the
file, as in “<CODE>fontforge Ambrosia.sfd</CODE>”.
</UL>

<P> XXX FontForge can open fonts of many (but not all) formats, allowing
them to be altered, enhanced, and converted. Some fonts may contain features
or elements not recognized by FontForge even though other parts of the file
are. (XXX intellectual property note.)

<H2 id="Navigating">Navigating to a glyph</H2>

<P> The font view provides one way of navigating around the glyphs in a font.
Simple scroll around it until you find the glyph you need and then double click
on it to open a window looking at that glyph.

<P> Also, typing a glyph (with a one-character name) will move to that glyph.

<P> However some fonts are huge (Chinese, Japanese and Korean fonts have thousands
or even tens of thousands of glyphs) and scrolling around the font view is
a an inefficient way of finding your glyph. <CODE>View-&gt;Goto</CODE> provides
a simple dialog which will allow you to move directly to any glyph for which
you know the name (or encoding). If your font is a Unicode font, then this
dialog will also allow you to find glyphs by block name (ie. Hebrew rather
than Alef).

<P> The simplest way to navigate, once a character is opened in an Outline or
Bitmap view, is just to go to the next or previous glyph.  And
<CODE>View-&gt;Next Char</CODE> and <CODE>View-&gt;Prev Char</CODE> will do
exactly that.
